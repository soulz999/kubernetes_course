# We vary the scheduler by setting the "ExecStart" on the kubernetes cluster:
# ExecStart= /usr/local/bin/kube-scheduler --config=/etc/kubernetes/config/my-scheduler-config.yaml

#Nowadays we install kubernetes wit kubeadm and it does not uses the service. So a way of creating our scheduler is by creating the yaml manifest.
